        <h4>Ever felt like looking at the stars indoors? Ever wanted to stargaze, but also learn about those stars? We'll you've come to the right place! Welcome to Polaris!</h4>
        <br> <br>

        <h2>What is Polaris?</h2>
        <p> Polaris is an educational website, inspired by astronomy apps such as Stellarium, depicting the celestial bodies visible on Earth. The site itself will contain the general information about astronomy and the sky, but the star page would be the online planetarium.  Here, the planetarium software will show the location of constellations, planets, asteroids, satellite star clusters, and more shown as their actual position in the night sky, in a 3D simulation. Changing settings can display constellation lines and drawings, modify the environment and light pollution, as well as the camera and telescope settings. With the camera FOV and telescope functions, the zoom of the screen can be changed according to the user’s settings. One can also change the time and location of the player on Earth, in which the software also changes the position of every celestial object in the sky accordingly. </p>
        <p> There is also a sidebar in which one can select certain objects such as constellations, planets, asteroids, and satellites. Once clicked, the user can view a zoomed-in interactive diagram of the chosen object, as well as further scientific explanations and research on the bottom.</p>
    	<p> What sets Polaris apart from other websites, aside from our detailed customization, is our in depth information per constellation. Here, we will compile research from all around the internet and make it easy to read and access. Simply clicking the constellation will allow you to enter a new webpage where information can be found. All of this, of course, taken with citations and all the details you could need to know. <p>
        <p> So, what are you waiting for? To start, check on our <a class="funs" href="space.html">Guide on Space</a> for information on stars, planets, and all the gadgets and gizmos out there. Or, try our <a class="funs" href="guide.html">How to Use</a> page if you feel lost any part of our Polaris software. And, for information on the creators, check out the <a class="funs" href="authorinfo.html">About Us</a> page! Good luck explorer and happy stargazing!! <p>

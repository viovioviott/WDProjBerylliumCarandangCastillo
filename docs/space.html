    <p class="welcome"> Welcome to the Guide on Space! Take a look at some of our featured Celestial bodies… </p>

    <h3>Galaxies:</h3>
    <p>A combination of stars, planets, clouds of dust, gas and particles all bound by gravity. Most galaxies hold blackholes at its center, the mass and force of which pulls each celestial body to form a galaxy. These can come in elliptic, circular or spiral shapes, some in irregular appearances as well </p>
    <p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is approximately 100,000 light-years in diameter and just 1000 light-years thick. It holds a barred spiral shape and has been around for around 13.6 billion years. As stated above, our galaxy is held together by a supermassive black hole named Sagittarius A. Due to its weight of about 4 million times the mass of the sun, it consumes anything that strays too close to it. </p>
    
    <h3>Nebulae:</h3>
    <p>Similar to the galaxy, a nebula is a cloud of dust and gas—specifically hydrogen and helium. However, these particles are thrown out of the explosion from a dying star such as a supernova. A supernova is when the nuclear fuel of the cores of stars, whom form pressure to hold up the star, run out. This causes the star to collapse into itself and explode. These explosions form what we know as nebula, also known as regions for new stars to form.</p>

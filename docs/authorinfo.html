        <h3>Marcus Carandang</h3>
        <p>Funny and humorous among his friends, one would not see at first glance how serious Marcus can be when it comes to space, physics, computers, and the like. Ever since he started reading and watching all things about the universe and rocket ships as a young boy, he has always kept astronomy in his heart, in spite of his many interests. He hopes that through this project, he can skillfully combine his deft skills in both technology and outer space into a piece of software that can hopefully help fellow aspiring astronomers.</p>

        <h3>Violet Castillo</h3>
        <p>Hiya! I’m Vie, the other half of the ✧˖* Polaris Authors °࿐ !! I personally designed the website, as well as majority of the CSS and HTML (including the js) parts. If you asked me, this project began the second Marcus and I heard what our project would be this year. We both have a fascination over stars and space, and we knew immediately we would team, Marcus with his brains and me with my design. My Kuya, Lukas Castillo from batch 2026, had his project as the best in the batch, and as his predecessor, I feel the need to reach the same level of achievement as he did.</p>
